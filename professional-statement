Professional strengths that I currently possess are a strong technical aptitude for problem solving and time management. One strength that I would like to master would be Python or SQL.

Current Values that I have are protecting and safeguarding organizations, adhering to guidelines and laws. 

One thing that interests me the most about cyber security are how Malware operates and how to reverse engineer a threat. My audience for my professional statement would be cyber security recruiters or mom and pop shops that need guidance on how to better safeguard their business from cyber criminals.

I feel that my strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the
security goals of various organizations by keeping their assets and data safe.


I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.
