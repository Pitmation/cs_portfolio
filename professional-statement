Hello, my name is Matt Mattatall and I love all things IT! Iâ€™ve always had a knack for computers and taking them apart and putting them back together. I started in the IT field at a young age and over the years I have taken a strong interest into Cyber Security. Some of the strong technical skills that I possess are an aptitude for problem solving and time management. One strength that I would like to master would be Python or SQL.

Current Values that I have are protecting and safeguarding organizations, adhering to guidelines and laws. 

One thing that interests me the most about cyber security are how malware operates and how to reverse engineer a threat. My audience for my professional statement would be cyber security recruiters or mom and pop shops that need guidance on how to better safeguard their business from cyber criminals.

I feel that my strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the security goals of various organizations by keeping their assets and data safe.

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike
